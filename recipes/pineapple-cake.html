  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    To Make this cake, you will need :
  <ul>
    <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings</li>
    <li>¼ cup water, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 (16.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Betty Crocker Super Moist)</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 large egg whites</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups brown sugar</li>
    <li>7 maraschino cherries</li>
  </ul>

  After checking to have all the ingredients, to make the cake, you will need to :
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
      Drain canned pineapple into a 1-cup measure. Add water if needed to measure 1 cup. Set aside juice and 7 pineapple
      rings
      for the cake. Set any remaining juice and rings aside for another use.

    </li>
    <li>
      Melt butter in a 10- or 11-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat
    </li>
    <li>
      While the butter is melting, combine cake mix, reserved 1 cup pineapple juice, vegetable oil, and egg whites in a
      mixing
      bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>
      Remove melted butter from the heat and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over top until all butter is covered. Arrange 6
      pineapple rings around the outer edge of the skillet and the remaining ring in the center without overlapping.
      Place a
      maraschino cherry into the center of each pineapple ring. Pour cake batter over the pineapples.

    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from the oven and let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes; don't let the cake cool too much or it will stick
      to
      the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Run an offset spatula around the edges to gently loosen cake. Place a plate over the skillet, then flip and
      carefully
      turn the warm cake out onto a plate. Transfer any fruit or glaze that sticks in the skillet back to the cake.
    </li>
  </ol>
